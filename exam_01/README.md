none of these work like they're supposed to and I did not get to 2.2. for 1 I attempted to make a while loop that would output no ditribution if the values = 0 because then cake distribution can't happen with 0 amounts and if there was no 0 value, then the function would output the divided integer value. it didn't even output an integer. For 2.1 I attemped a for loop with lists and I couldnt figure out how to get the vowel items to eliminate from the words in the list in time, I'm very sorry.
